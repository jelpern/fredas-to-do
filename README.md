# fredas-to-do
A very simple to-do list web "app", created to demonstrate basic programming ability. A running version is online at http://fredas-to-do.appspot.com/. Also: my first repository on GitHub.

KNOWN ISSUES: After you add a task, it will look like nothing has been added to the list. You have to hit 'Update' for it to appear.

BACKSTORY

I used to be a professional software developer. I wrote Java code for an Israeli software development consultancy from 1999-2000. I studied computer science at Brown University, where I was near top of my cohort. 

But I couldn't stand being locked away from the rest of campus in the dark, secluded Sun Lab (as the CS lab was called then). Also, the dot-com bubble burst, and I had all sorts of bad associations with being a programmer. So I left the fold for the dark side (business). I became a sales engineer, then a management consultant, then worst of all ... an MBA. After graduating from Wharton, I went into the finance side: corporate development, then venture capital.

Working in venture capital, oddly, had an unanticipated effect. Though I was more technical than 95% of the VCs, I felt frustrated that I couldn't dive in with the entrepreneurs to really understand their code, and alienated from all the cool things that were going on with web apps and APIs and mashups. I also had an epiphany that I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I left my cushy role and launched a startup in, naturally: craft beer.

Craft beer turned out not to be such a great place to build an ecommerce company, but it was indeed an area that I had a great passion in. I'll skip over the details of that experience here other than to say that it was awesome and highly educational, but ultimately did not find product/market fit. And so I found myself with some time on my hands ...

... which leads us to today. I have taken advantage of the downtime to (re)learn to code, using modern tools and frameworks. I learned Python while taking a Udacity course on Web Development, and started messing around with whether anyone would hire me as a software engineering intern. During one such conversation, I was told somewhat condescendingly that before anyone would talk to me I had to be able to build an end-to-end To-Do app that had a web front end, an application server layer, and a persistent storage backend. That's what this is. It isn't much, but it works. The conversation took place at a restaurant called Jack's Wife Freda; hence the name.
